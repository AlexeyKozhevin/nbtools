# **NBtools**

Collection of utility functions to interact with Jupyter Notebooks.

I've intentionally opted not to reuse code from **nbstat** module: that is to contain the code in one place and avoid dependencies.

All of the non-standard imports are performed inside the functions that use them to avoid introducing dependencies to the package.
